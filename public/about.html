      <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Jarrod Drake! I am a K-12 teacher with eight years of experience, currently living and working in San Antonio.
          I attended Anderson University in Indiana, where I earned a bachelor's in music education along with a K-12 teaching certification. 
          I am a self-taught programmer with a lifelong passion for technology and computers. I am happily married to my wife of nine years and am the father of four beautiful children.

          After graduating from AU, I accepted a math teaching position here in San Antonio at Texas Military Institute. After teaching there for two years I was asked to be a coach for their Robotics teams. 
          Without any real experience in that area, I began teaching myself the programming required for their robots. That sparked an immediate passion for programming that I continued to expand on over the following years.
          After three years at TMI, I moved on to my second school, Cornerstone Christian Schools, where I accepted a position teaching choir and piano. After my first semester there, Covid happened, and our school went fully remote. 
          The choir was effectively disbanded at that point, and I offered to teach robotics and computer science instead. I've been teaching STEAM, robotics, and Computer science ever since.

          Over the last four years I've taken approximately 200 hours of online classes and professional development for programming and computer science. One of the best classes I took was Foundations of Computer Science for Teachers, 
          which was offered through UT Austin. The class filled in a lot of the gaps in my content knowledge from not having a formal computer science education. After finishing that course, I decided to test for, and successfully earned, my 8-12 computer science teaching certificate.
          I am an excellent learner, a hard worker, and am ready for new challenges.
